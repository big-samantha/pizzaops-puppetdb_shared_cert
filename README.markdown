## Overview

Generates a shared certificate to be used for load-balancing PuppetDB nodes in Puppet Enterprise, as per the documented [known issue](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/3.7/release_notes_known_issues.html#puppetdb-behind-a-load-balancer-causes-puppet-server-errors).

## Module Description

This module uses `reidmv-puppet_certificate` to generate certificates on the CA node, and then distributes them to the PuppetDB node via standard file resources, before the puppet_enterprise::puppetdb class tries to copy them into PuppetDB's ssl directory.

## Setup

`puppet module install pizzaops-puppetdb_shared_cert`

If you're using r10k, you'll need to include the dependencies, `puppetlabs-stdlib` 4.5.0, and `reidmv-puppet_certificate` 0.0.2.

## Usage

Classify the CA master with `puppetdb_shared_cert::ca`. By default, it will create a certificate with a certname of `pe-internal-puppetdb` and alt-names of `puppetdb, puppetdb.${::domain}`.

```
class { 'puppetdb_shared_cert::ca':
  certname      => 'puppetdb-shared-cert',
  dns_alt_names => ['puppetdb.bar.com','puppetdb'],
}
```

Classify your PuppetDB nodes with `puppetdb_shared_cert::puppetdb`, and the standard `puppet_enterprise::profile::puppetdb` class. `puppetdb_shared_cert::puppetdb` will ship the certs generated by the CA class to your puppetdb nodes. It has the same defaults as the ca class.

```
class { 'puppetdb_shared_cert::puppetdb':
  certname      => 'puppetdb-shared-cert',
  dns_alt_names => ['puppetdb.bar.com','puppetdb'],
}
```

You may also supply all data directly to the `::puppetdb_shared_cert` class to reduce duplication.
